# Create Epics

## Identity Management

```
Create an epic user story around identity management
for the ACME, Inc. e-commerce platform.
Think hard about architecture and design of this bounded context service.
List features that this service will provide. Keep things high-level and avoid
making technology choices here.
Broad acceptance criteria are welcomed, but more detailed acceptance criteria will
be created when this epic user story is decomposed into smaller, focused user
stories.
All diagrams should use Mermaid.js. No ASCII art. 
Write the content to @documentation/epics/000-identity-management.md.
Take into account the architecture patterns and standards documented in
@documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md.
Create a feature branch from the `main` branch for this work.
Commit all changes to this feature branch.
When completed, create a PR for merging this feature branch back into
the `main` branch on GitHub.
```
